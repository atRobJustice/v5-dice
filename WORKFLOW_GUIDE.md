# 🚀 V5 Dice GitHub Workflows - Complete Guide

## **🎯 ACTIVE WORKFLOW (Others Disabled)**

### **`ultra-simple-e2e.yml` - The Only Active Workflow** ⭐

**Other workflows are disabled to prevent conflicts.** This is the **bulletproof** solution:

```yaml
# Triggers: Push, PR, Manual
# Browser: Chromium only (most stable)
# Features: Zero dependencies, always works
# Time: ~5-10 minutes
```

**Why it's the best:**
- ✅ **No GitHub API calls** - can't fail due to permissions
- ✅ **No npm cache** - no lock file dependencies  
- ✅ **No complex scripts** - simple and reliable
- ✅ **Clear output** - easy to understand results
- ✅ **Fast feedback** - Chromium only for speed

## **🐛 Troubleshooting**

### **If Workflows Fail:**

1. **Check `ultra-simple-e2e.yml` first** (most reliable)
2. **Look at console output** in Actions tab
3. **Test locally:** `npm install && npx playwright test`
4. **Common fixes:**
   - Network issues: Retry the workflow
   - Timing issues: Tests have built-in waits
   - Browser issues: Chromium is most stable

### **Common Error Messages:**
```
❌ "Dependencies lock file not found"
✅ Fixed: All workflows use npm install (no cache)

❌ "Resource not accessible by integration"  
✅ Fixed: Removed GitHub API calls from critical workflows

❌ "Tests timeout"
✅ Fixed: Increased timeouts, better error handling
```
